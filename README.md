1. Array Sorting Program (ArraySorting.java)
Description:
The Array Sorting program takes user input for an array of integers, sorting the elements in descending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm. The program prompts the user for the array size and individual elements, then prints the sorted array.

2. Array Statistics Program (ArrayStatistics.java)
Description:
The Array Statistics program calculates statistical measures (median, variance, standard deviation, and sum of squares) for an array of integers. It prompts the user for the array size and elements, sorts the array in ascending order, and then performs the statistical calculations.

3. Matrix Multiplication Program (MatrixMultiplication.java)
Description:
The Matrix Multiplication program performs matrix multiplication for two matrices. It prompts the user for the dimensions and elements of the matrices, calculates the product using the Strassen algorithm for larger matrices, and prints the resulting matrix.
